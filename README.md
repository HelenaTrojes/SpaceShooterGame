The **Space Shooter Game** is a fun, interactive 2D arcade game developed as part of the **Code Labs** - semester project. The game features a player-controlled spaceship that must battle against waves of animated octopus enemies. Players can shoot lasers to destroy enemies while avoiding their attacks and trying to stay alive as long as possible. ‚òÑÔ∏è
